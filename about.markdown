I'm a software developer and musical director from Norfolk, England. I graduated from [Brown University][brown] in 2015 and the [Royal Conservatoire of Scotland][rcs] in 2016. I freelanced in musical theatre in Glasgow from 2016 and London from 2019. I retrained as an iOS developer in 2020, and was hired as as Junior iOS Developer at Manchester-based app agency [Degree 53][degree53] in August 2020.
